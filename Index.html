<h3 class="chicken">Chicken</h3>
<p>A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs.[1] They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance. Some sleep in trees if there are trees around.

A male chicken is called a rooster or a cockerel. A female chicken is called a hen. A young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks.

When raising chickens, a farmer needs a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this.

Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs</p>

<h3 class="beef">Beef</h3>
<p>One of the main objectives of cattle rearing is to obtain meat or beef. Beef cattle are much more widely distributed than dairy cattle because they are harder and can tolerate wider range of physical and climatic conditions.
They can survive on sparse pasturage. Beef cattle rearing are also the means of livelihood for thousands of people in many areas of Asia and Africa.
While in many countries like Argentina, Australia, New Zealand it is done for the commercial purpose. Due to the introduction of refrigeration in the 1880s, the international trade in beef expanded rapidly.
Chilled meat is transported in cold storage chambers at a temperature just below freezing point, so that it arrives in the consuming countries in fresh state. There is a considÂ­erable trade in corned beef (canned, cooked meat), beef extracts, ox-tongues and other prepared and cooked canned beef products.
There are several breeds of beef cattle. Western Europe is the home of many beef cattle breeds. The Aberdeen Angus breed originated in Abesdeenshire, Scotland. It was first imported into the USA in 1850 and now a new breed, the Red Angus become important. The Hereford breeds now cross-breed called Polled Hereford, developed in US and Canada.</p></div>

	<h3 class="sushi">Sushi</h3>
		<p>Some of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children.

According to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish.This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more.The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover, are also a concern as well</p></div>
